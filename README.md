This repository presents a computational pipeline for large-scale analysis of AI sociotechnical imaginaries in news media, developed as part of my Master's thesis. The pipeline is based on the SIPCs framework developed in the paper "Sociotechnical imaginaries and public communication: Analytical framework and empirical illustration using the case of artificial intelligence" (Brause et al., 2025). Given that AI has become central to public debate, the number of published articles addressing AI topics has grown substantially, especially with the overall increasing production of articles on news websites. The use of computational methods thus becomes essential to enable researchers to conduct large-scale systematic analyses to handle larger volumes of articles

Technology use in this project
1. Natural Language Inference
Zero-shot classifiers developed by Laurer et al. (2023), available on Laurer's Hugging Face Hub (https://huggingface.co/collections/MoritzLaurer/zeroshot-classifiers-6548b4ff407bb19ff5c3ad6f) Specifically, the multilingual model MoritzLaurer/bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0 was used for article classification across SIPCs framework dimensions.
2. Topic Modeling
BERTopic (https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) was employed for topic modeling and semantic clustering. The Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model was used as the embedding model due to its larger token window, enabling better processing of longer news articles.
